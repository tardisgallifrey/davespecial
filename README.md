# Dave's Special, not so special app

I've been a C programmer for a very long time, but have never really gotten round to just writing my own app.  Now, I am doing that.

Just in the beginning stages.  I have a few functions written.  I'm going for one function per file.  We'll see how that goes.

The basic data record is just a struct.
```
struct Record {
     int id;
     char data1[50];
     char data2[50];
     long hash;
   }

```

Very generic.  Data isn't the goal.  Just having a good app that runs and does it's job is the goal.  We'll have to see how it goes from here.
